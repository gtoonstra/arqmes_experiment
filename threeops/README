"Three ops"  are three ways to run a specific application.

- threeops_original.py  is a script that runs code to retrieve the playlist of BBC radio using a standard script, how
                        someone would probably start off writing code before any optimization

- threeops_synchronous.py is code after some restructuring. It is more modularized and some cross-cutting concerns 
                        are taken care of (logging) to facilitate log handling later (through configuration).

- threeops_asynchronous.py shows the further evolution of the code to make better use of the CPU. Instead of explicitly waiting
                        for the REST call to finish, the application now processes as much as it can in general to "progress"
                        processing of the application.
